Integrates with Swedish Sector Alarm home alarm system (most likely works in all countries serviced by Sector Alarm).
Currently implements Alarm panel, Locks, Temperature and Smartplugs

**NOTE**

On alarm installation which are not wired make sure you take the binary sensor "Online" into account to ensure the alarm state is a trusted state

The entity for alarm panel will only update it's state on alarms which are online

## Configuration Options

Set once:

- Username: Your e-mail address linked to Sector Alarm account
- Password: Password used for app or Sector website
- Enable Temp sensors (Not recommended and turned off by default due to long api response time)

Options that you can change at any time:

- Code Format: Number of digits in code

## Installation

### Option 1 (preferred)
